MuseBox
=========

Be a one-man band with your brain. Translate your auditory imagination to actual audio, complete with snare drums and cymbals. 

*Uses WebSockets to receive data through TCP from our Muse EEG device. Analyses incoming streams of brainwaves, and plays instruments at varying voltage thresholds.

*Useful for meditating and gaining control of thoughts and imagination. Precision of thought help you get focused, and become one with yourself. Perhaps even more important for those with autism and other brain disorders, to obtain a better sense of coordination and concentration.

*paulirish's code provided a framework for obtaining socketed data from the Muse, which was used to check for thresholds and modified to provide visual feedback.
